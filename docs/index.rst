snakePipes are pipelines built using `snakemake <snakemake.readthedocs.io>`__ and *python* for the analysis of epigenomic datasets.


Below is the list of pipelines available in snakePipes
------------------------------------------------------

=============================== ===============================================================================================================
Pipeline                            Description
=============================== ===============================================================================================================
:ref:`createIndices`            Create indices for an organism for further use within snakePipes
:ref:`DNA-mapping`              Basic DNA mapping using bowtie2, filter mapped files, QC and create coverage plots
:ref:`ChIP-Seq`                 Use the DNA mapping output and run ChIP/Input normalization and peak calling
:ref:`ATAC-seq`                 Use the DNA mapping output and detect open chromatin regions for ATAC-seq data
:ref:`HiC`                      Hi-C analysis workflow, from mapping to TAD calling
:ref:`noncoding-RNA-Seq`        noncoding-RNA-Seq workflow : From mapping to differential expression of genes and repeat elements using DESeq2
:ref:`mRNA-Seq`                 RNA-Seq workflow : From mapping to differential expression using DESeq2
:ref:`scRNA-Seq`                Single-cell RNA-Seq (CEL-Seq2) workflow : From mapping to differential expression
:ref:`WGBS`                     Whole-genome Bisulfite-Seq analysis workflow, from mapping to DMR calling and differential methylation analysis
:ref:`preprocessing`            Merging technical replicates (e.g., across lanes), removing optical duplicates, running FastQC

Quick start
-----------

* Assuming you have *python3* with *conda*, install snakePipes with:

.. code:: bash

    conda create -n snakePipes -c mpi-ie -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakePipes

* You can update snakePipes to the latest version available on conda with:

.. code:: bash

    conda update -n snakePipes -c mpi-ie -c bioconda -c conda-forge snakePipes

* Download genome fasta and annotations for an your organism, and build indexes, Check in :ref:`createIndices`

* Download example fastq files for the human genome `here <https://zenodo.org/record/3707259>`_

* Execute the DNA-mapping pipeline using the example **command.sh** in the test data directory.


Running your own analysis
-------------------------

For a detail introduction to setting up snakePipes from scratch, please visit :doc:`content/setting_up`

For each organism of interest, snakePipes requires fasta files, genome indexes and annotation files.
Paths to these files are specified in the organism/<name>.yaml files. After installation, the location
of these files could be revealed by the following command:

.. code:: bash

    snakePipes info

You could either modify the existing files (add your own paths), or add a new file there. See more detail in
:doc:`content/running_snakePipes`

snakePipes could either be executed locally, or on any snakemake-supported cluster infrastructure. See details
for setting up the cluster command in :doc:`content/running_snakePipes`
